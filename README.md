# STM32-42StepMotor Control Example
## Description
Here we provide an example to **produce relatively accurate 1ms delay in STM32 without interrupts**.  
The Keil5 project **BH-F103** is contained in file **Project**

## Experiments
We test two delay funcitons using an LED, see https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ku411D7sc?p=3

 ## Results
 
 The more concise the delay function, the more accurate the delay.
